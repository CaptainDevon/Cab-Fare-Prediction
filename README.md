# Linear Regression Model

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a Linear Regression model using Python. The implementation is performed in a Jupyter Notebook and focuses on predicting a target variable based on provided features. The dataset used is assumed to be structured for supervised learning tasks.

## Project Structure

- **`linearRegressionModel.ipynb`**: The core file of this project containing all the code related to data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

## Key Sections of the Notebook

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration
The dataset is loaded into the environment and explored to understand its structure. This includes:
- Displaying the first few rows of the dataset.
- Checking for missing values.
- Understanding feature distributions and target variable.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
Before building the model, data preprocessing is performed to ensure the data is clean and usable for the regression task. This includes:
- Handling missing values.
- Scaling or normalizing features if necessary.
- Splitting the dataset into training and test sets (commonly an 80:20 or 70:30 ratio).

### 3. Model Building
A linear regression model is built using scikit-learn's `LinearRegression` class:
- The training set is used to fit the model.
- Model coefficients and intercept are calculated.

### 4. Model Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated on the test set using common regression metrics:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of errors in predictions.
- **R-squared Score**: Represents the proportion of variance explained by the model.

### 5. Visualizations
Visualizations include:
- Plotting the actual vs predicted values to visualize model performance.
- A residual plot to analyze the errors.

### 6. Predictions
The model is used to make predictions on new data and evaluate how well it generalizes.

## Output
After executing the notebook, the following outputs are generated:
1. **Model Coefficients**: The learned weights for each feature in the linear regression model.
2. **Model Intercept**: The bias term added to the linear equation.
3. **Prediction Results**: The predicted values for the target variable.
4. **Performance Metrics**: MSE, MAE, and R-squared values to evaluate model accuracy.
